#Phase 2: Narowing down the Application#

##Task Finalization##

From the list of tasks that you provided in phase 1, select 1 or 2 that you intent to implement in your application or provide ease to the society by applying HCI concepts to that task. 

##Need Finding##

How can Student study at Home? 

First, Government should provide free shipping service. They need to work with every school (Public or Private). Then the duty of each school is to pack each student textbook and confirmed the mailing address for each student. And then delivered them through any courier company (TCS) to each student one by one. Meanwhile, some schools offer free electronic textbooks for students to download. 

We know that there are so many disadvantages, such as “no interaction”. But we have to consider the fact that in Pakistan, not each family has a computer for study, but each family has a TV. And in fact, after 2 months studying, lots of families preferred their children to study by TV, because its screen is so big that parents don't need to worry about eyesight, and because the TVs are usually in the living room, so parents can watch their kid's study. 

Second, students can study at home through the following ways: 
Cable TV, Mobile Phone, Computer/PC 

It can be used for Junior school students (I, II, III).  As for the Middle and Senior school students, there are more complex platforms such as, WhatsApp, Google classroom, Edmodo, Zoom, etc.  
More importantly, teachers can distribute homework and correct papers on the platform and can also do online tests on it. 
We have practiced online study for nearly five months now. Although there are so many difficulties, but still teachers are trying their best to ensure that each student receives their right to education. 


Who are the major target? 

Major targets are Teachers and Students. 


##Design Alternatives##

1) List down at-least 10 design alternatives.
2) Based on your research above, Develop personas, scenarios and storyboards which will provide you with insight of how actually your designs will be used.
- 6-7 personas
- 4 scenarios
- 4 storyboards
3) Brainstorm few questions from perspective of each persona in each scenario and story.  
4) Based on those question finalize at-least 2 designs.

##Prototyping##
Develop low fidelity prototypes for each of the 2 disgns selected above. 


##Evaluation##
Get the prototypes evaluated quickly by someone in your family or circle.
